This Conversion code will be configured to send revenue and the Order ID with each conversion. Overview Setting up an AdWords conversion code requires a base Gtag to be installed on all pages, as well as an event snippet on the checkout success page. The following information is necessary before this setup can be completed: Google Ads Conversion ID (Account specific) Google Ads Conversion Label (Conversion Specific) The conversion ID can be found within the base Gtag snippet for the Google Ads account. The Event Snippet for the specific conversion contains all of the required information. The following snippet shows where to find both of these values in an Event Snippet (Labeled CONVERSION_ID and CONVERSION_LABEL respectively): script gtag('event', 'conversion', { 'send_to': 'AW-CONVERSION_ID/CONVERSION_LABEL', 'value': 0, 'currency': 'USD', 'transaction_id': '' }); /script Step 1 - Installing the Gtag Base Code To begin tracking conversions on a Shopify store, we must first configure a global site tag for our Google Ads account. If a Base Code was provided in the ticket, use that. You can also generate a new one with the template below, replacing the CONVERSION_ID value wherever it appears: script async src= https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-CONVERSION_ID /script script window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'AW-CONVERSION_ID'); /script Once you have the Global Site Tag base code prepared you can install it by following these steps: Navigate to the Online Store section of the store Click Actions Edit Code Open the theme.liquid file if it was not opened by default Paste the base code within the head /head sections of the template file Click Save Step 2 - Installing the Event Snippet Shopify does not use the theme.liquid file on the checkout pages, so we will need to add the base Gtag snippet a second time during this step. The Event Snippet will require some customization before it can be installed, so it will be easiest to extract the Conversion ID and Label from the event snippet provided. Once you have these values use them to populate the following template, replacing CONVERSION_ID and CONVERSION_LABEL wherever they appear: script async src= https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-CONVERSION_ID /script script window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'AW-CONVERSION_ID'); /script {% if first_time_accessed %} script gtag('event', 'conversion', { 'send_to': 'AW-CONVERSION_ID/CONVERSION_LABEL', 'value': {{ subtotal_price | money_without_currency }}, 'currency': 'USD', 'transaction_id': '{{ order_number }}' }); /script {% endif %} Once you have this template prepared, install it by following these steps: Click Settings in the Shopify store Click Checkout Scroll down the page until you find a text box labeled Additional Scripts Paste the populated template in the Additional Scripts section Click Save Summary This concludes the setup for Google Ads conversion tracking on Shopify stores. While we can't test purchase based conversions, you can test the frontend of the site to ensure that the Gtag base code was added to all pages using Tag Assistant.
